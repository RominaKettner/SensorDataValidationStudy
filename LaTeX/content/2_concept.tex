\section{Comparing Consumer Goods against Professional Sensor Kits}

As previously described there has not been much work on the validation of consumer goods recording physiological data. 
In our work, we aimed to compare the Apple watch, the Microsoft band II and the Polar chest strap to the Nexus Kit using professional sensors. 

- explain why we chose these three consumer goods (and why the Nexus Kit is not a consumer good) 
- list the physiological and other data we accessed 
- proving a cool figure that sums up the concept (including our activity conditions and the arousal accessment)
