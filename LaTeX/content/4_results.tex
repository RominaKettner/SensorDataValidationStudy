\section{Results}

Accessing various data, we first analyzed the physiological and then focused on the arousal and stress accessment. 

\subsection{Physiological Data: EDA, ECG, and Skin Temperature}
 
 - provide descripitive resuls -> plot including these three values/measures and baseline measurements 
 


\subsection{Arousal and Stress Accessment}

 - provide descripitive resuls -> plot including these three values/measures and baseline measurements 
 
 
\subsection{Inferential Statistics}

- report on th t-test we calculated 
- report on the correlation we calculated 
- provide for a table as an overview for what we calculated 

- plot the relevant data in graph 

- provide another table including the significant results of the t-tests only 
- provide another table including the significant results of the correlations only
